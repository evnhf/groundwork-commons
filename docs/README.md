# Groundwork Commons Documentation

Welcome to the Groundwork Commons documentation hub. This documentation is organized to serve different audiences and purposes.

## Documentation Structure

### [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](adrs/README.md)
Formal records of architectural and governance decisions made during the project. Each ADR documents the context, decision, and consequences of significant choices.

**Audience**: Contributors, node operators, technical community members

### [Musings](musings/README.md)
Exploratory thoughts, design explorations, and technical investigations. These are free-form documents that explore ideas before they crystallize into formal decisions.

**Audience**: Contributors, anyone interested in the design process

### [Technical Documentation](technical/README.md)
System architecture, API documentation, implementation details, and technical specifications.

**Audience**: Developers, contributors, technical operators

### [Governance Framework](governance/README.md)
Democratic processes, voting mechanisms, node operator policies, moderation guidelines, and community decision-making procedures.

**Audience**: Community members, node operators, potential adopters

### [Deployment Guide](deployment/README.md)
Instructions for setting up nodes, infrastructure requirements, hosting options, and operational procedures.

**Audience**: Node operators, system administrators

## Contributing to Documentation

As Groundwork Commons is in concept development, documentation evolves rapidly:

1. **Musings** capture exploratory thinking and early-stage ideas
2. **ADRs** formalize decisions once they've been made
3. **Technical docs** document implementation as it's built
4. **Governance docs** define community processes
5. **Deployment docs** provide operational guidance

Documentation follows the same GPL v3 license as the project code.

## Documentation Principles

- **Transparency**: Document the reasoning behind decisions, not just the decisions themselves
- **Accessibility**: Write for people unfamiliar with distributed systems
- **Evolution**: Documentation reflects current thinking; historical decisions are preserved in ADRs
- **Community ownership**: Documentation is part of the infrastructure communities own
