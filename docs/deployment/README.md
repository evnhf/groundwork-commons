# Deployment Guide

**Status**: Under Development

This guide will provide instructions for deploying and operating Groundwork Commons nodes. As the project is in concept development, deployment procedures are being designed alongside the technical architecture.

## Overview

Groundwork Commons operates on 3-5 nodes run by different community members. Each node continuously syncs with others to provide redundancy and prevent single points of failure.

## Deployment Topics

This section will cover:

### Node Setup
- Hardware requirements
- Software dependencies
- Installation procedures
- Initial configuration
- Security hardening

### Hosting Options
- Cloud VPS deployment (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)
- Self-hosted servers (home servers, Raspberry Pi)
- Future mesh network support
- Hybrid hosting strategies

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Bandwidth and storage needs
- Uptime commitments
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Monitoring and alerting

### Network Configuration
- Node discovery and connection
- Replication setup between nodes
- Firewall and security configuration
- SSL/TLS certificates

### Operational Procedures
- Node maintenance and updates
- Database management
- Log monitoring
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Performance tuning

## Node Operator Responsibilities

Operating a node is both a technical and community responsibility:

- **Technical**: Maintain uptime, apply updates, monitor performance
- **Governance**: Participate in moderation and voting
- **Community**: Support other operators, help onboard new communities

## Getting Started

When deployment documentation is complete, this section will provide:

1. Quickstart guide for first-time operators
2. Step-by-step installation walkthrough
3. Configuration templates and examples
4. Testing and validation procedures
5. Going live checklist

## Cost Estimates

Preliminary cost estimates for node operation:

- **Cloud VPS**: $5-15/month depending on provider and specs
- **Self-hosted**: One-time hardware cost ($35+ for Raspberry Pi, $200+ for dedicated server)
- **Bandwidth**: Usually included in VPS plans, minimal for self-hosted
- **Time commitment**: 2-4 hours setup, ~1 hour/month maintenance
