# Distributed Resilience: Multi-Node Replication vs Federation

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: Exploratory

## The Core Problem

I'm interested in creating distributed systems, but the fit isn't quite right for traditional federation (like ActivityPub or ATProto). The key question is: How can we utilize a node-based hosting strategy where data syncs between nodes that might be owned by different people?

**Example scenario**: If my neighbor Dan hosts his own instance and he already has an account, the multi-node architecture ensures resilience in hosting and removes my ability to just turn things off when/if I get mad at someone on the platform.

## Federation vs Distributed Resilience

This is fundamentally different from what ATProto or ActivityPub solve.

### Traditional Federation Solves:
- Discovery across networks
- Identity portability
- Cross-instance communication

### What We Actually Need:
- Multi-node redundancy within a SINGLE community
- Data replication for resilience
- Democratic control preventing admin tyranny
- No single point of failure (technical or social)

## The Vision: Multi-Master Replication

What if 3-5 neighbors each ran a node, and they all synced the same neighborhood database, so no single person could kill the community?

### Benefits:
- **Server goes down?** Other nodes still work
- **Admin goes rogue?** Community votes to demote them, other nodes continue
- **ISP outage?** Another node across town still serves the neighborhood
- **Operator moves away?** The community persists without them

This aligns with post-collapse resilience vision.

## Technical Approaches

### Option 1: Scuttlebutt (SSB)

**Architecture**:
- Gossip protocol: Nodes sync when they connect
- Append-only logs: Each user has a cryptographically signed feed
- Works offline: Data syncs opportunistically when nodes reconnect
- No central authority: Perfect for peer-to-peer neighborhoods
- Existing apps: Manyverse (social), Patchwork

**The fit**: Scuttlebutt was literally designed for small communities, resilience, offline-first. However, it's designed for individual identities, not shared community data.

**Considerations**:
- Would need adaptation for neighborhood-wide shared data model
- Strong offline-first capabilities
- Less mature ecosystem for forum-like features

### Option 2: CouchDB + PouchDB

**Architecture**:
- Multi-master replication: Every node is equal, bidirectional sync
- Conflict resolution: Built-in CRDT-like merging
- HTTP-based: Easy to understand, debug, deploy
- Proven: Used by companies for offline-first apps

**The fit**: Probably closest to what we want. Each node runs CouchDB, they replicate to each other, conflicts auto-resolve (last-write-wins or custom logic).

**Considerations**:
- Well-documented and mature
- HTTP API is accessible
- Good tooling and monitoring
- Straightforward deployment model

### Option 3: Gun.js

**Architecture**:
- Real-time distributed graph database
- No servers needed (though you can have server nodes)
- Cryptographic identity: Built-in security
- Resilient by design: Works peer-to-peer or with relay nodes

**The fit**: Very aligned with the vision, but less mature ecosystem than CouchDB.

**Considerations**:
- Novel approach, less production battle-testing
- Real-time sync could be compelling for UX
- Smaller community and ecosystem

## Proposed Architecture Sketch

```
[Node 1: Your house]  ←→  [Node 2: Dan's house]  ←→  [Node 3: Sarah's house]
      ↕                          ↕                          ↕
[Members access any node - data syncs between all nodes]
```

### How It Works:

1. **3-5 neighbors volunteer to run nodes** (Raspberry Pi, old laptop, VPS)
2. **Each node runs the same software** (forum + database)
3. **Nodes continuously sync** via bidirectional replication
4. **Members connect to any node** (if one is down, try another)
5. **Voting is cryptographically signed** (prevents tampering)

## The Governance Layer

This is where it gets interesting. We need democratic controls baked into the technical architecture.

### Node Operator Agreement:
- Any member can propose running a node
- Community votes to approve new node operators
- Minimum 3 nodes, maximum 7 (odd numbers for voting)
- Node operators commit to uptime SLA (90%+)

### Democratic Controls:

**Content moderation**: Any node operator can hide content, but it requires 2/3 vote to permanently delete

**Banning users**: Requires 2/3 vote of node operators

**Changing rules**: Constitutional amendments require 2/3 member vote

**Removing node operators**: Requires 2/3 vote, their node is de-replicated

### Technical Implementation:
- Use **signed messages** for all moderation actions
- Store votes in the replicated database
- Each node validates signatures and vote counts
- If node operator is voted out, their node stops receiving updates
- If they try to tamper, other nodes reject their changes (Byzantine fault tolerance lite)

## The "Nuclear Option" Protection

What if the majority of node operators collude or go rogue?

### Community Fork Mechanism:
- Any member can export the full database (it's replicated everywhere)
- They spin up new nodes with clean operators
- Previous operators are locked out
- Community migrates to new instance

This is like a **hard fork in blockchain governance**, but for neighborhood forums.

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: CouchDB-based Custom Build
- **Frontend**: Simple web app (React/Vue)
- **Backend**: Node.js API + CouchDB per node
- **Replication**: CouchDB's built-in multi-master sync
- **Cost per node**: $5-12/month VPS or self-hosted
- **Complexity**: Medium - CouchDB is well-documented

### Option 2: Adapt Existing Software
- Start with **Discourse** or **NodeBB** (both have plugin systems)
- Add **CouchDB replication layer** underneath
- Build **governance plugin** for voting
- **Cost**: Higher development ($15k-30k) but proven forum UX

### Option 3: Scuttlebutt Adaptation
- Fork **Manyverse** or **Patchwork**
- Adapt for neighborhood use case (not personal feeds)
- Add classifieds/marketplace modules
- **Cost**: Lower hosting (peer-to-peer) but higher learning curve

## Scaling to Multiple Neighborhoods

Each neighborhood runs their own 3-5 node cluster:

```
Oak Street (5 nodes) ←optional bridge→ Maple Avenue (3 nodes)
```

Bridges are opt-in and manual. Two neighborhoods can choose to link specific content categories (like "recommendations" or "emergency alerts") but keep marketplace posts separate.

## Why This Approach Is Compelling

1. **Resilience**: No single point of failure (technical or social)
2. **Democratic**: Built-in checks on admin power
3. **Post-collapse ready**: Works with intermittent internet, local mesh networks
4. **Anti-fragile**: Community can survive bad actors through voting
5. **Transition infrastructure**: Can evolve from VPS nodes → self-hosted → mesh networks → eventually offline

## Open Questions

1. **Conflict resolution**: How do we handle conflicting edits to the same post?
2. **Voting implementation**: Should votes be synchronous (all nodes online) or asynchronous?
3. **Bootstrap problem**: How does the first neighborhood get started with only 1-2 nodes?
4. **Identity management**: How do members authenticate across multiple nodes?
5. **Data model**: Forum-style threads, or something more flexible?
6. **Mobile access**: Do we need native apps or is mobile web sufficient?

## Next Steps

The database replication technology exists and is proven. The innovation is in:

1. **Governance layer** (voting, moderation, node operator management)
2. **UX simplicity** (members shouldn't think about nodes, just "the neighborhood forum")
3. **Platform coop structure** (legal + financial model)

Areas to explore further:
- Detailed governance voting system design
- CouchDB replication architecture deep-dive
- Conflict resolution strategies for community data
- Identity and authentication across nodes
- Initial deployment and bootstrap process
