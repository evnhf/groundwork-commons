# Distributed Resilience: Multi-Node Replication for Single Communities

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: Exploratory

## The Core Problem

I'm interested in creating distributed systems, but the fit isn't quite right for traditional cross-community federation protocols (like ActivityPub or ATProto). The key question is: How can we utilize a node-based hosting strategy where data syncs between nodes that might be owned by different people within a single neighborhood?

**Example scenario**: If my neighbor Dan hosts his own instance and he already has an account, the multi-node architecture ensures resilience in hosting and removes my ability to just turn things off when/if I get mad at someone on the platform.

**Important note**: The system should work perfectly well with a single node (realistic starting point for most neighborhoods), but support multiple nodes for redundancy without arbitrary upper limits.

## Multi-Node Replication vs Cross-Community Federation

This is fundamentally different from what ATProto or ActivityPub solve.

### Cross-Community Federation Protocols Solve:
- Discovery across separate networks
- Identity portability between communities
- Cross-instance communication and interoperability

### What We Actually Need:
- Multi-node redundancy within a SINGLE community
- Data replication for resilience
- Democratic control preventing admin tyranny
- No single point of failure (technical or social)

## The Vision: Multi-Master Replication

The system should work with a single node (realistic starting point) but support optional multi-node setups where neighbors sync the same neighborhood database for resilience.

### Single Node:
- **Simple start**: One person or organization hosts the neighborhood platform
- **All features work**: Forum, classifieds, moderation, membership
- **Lower barrier**: No coordination needed between multiple operators

### Multiple Nodes (Optional Resilience):
- **Server goes down?** Other nodes still work
- **Admin goes rogue?** Community votes to demote them, other nodes continue
- **ISP outage?** Another node across town still serves the neighborhood
- **Operator moves away?** The community persists without them

This aligns with post-collapse resilience vision while keeping initial adoption practical.

## Technical Approaches

### Option 1: Scuttlebutt (SSB)

**Architecture**:
- Gossip protocol: Nodes sync when they connect
- Append-only logs: Each user has a cryptographically signed feed
- Works offline: Data syncs opportunistically when nodes reconnect
- No central authority: Perfect for peer-to-peer neighborhoods
- Existing apps: Manyverse (social), Patchwork

**The fit**: Scuttlebutt was literally designed for small communities, resilience, offline-first. However, it's designed for individual identities, not shared community data.

**Considerations**:
- Would need adaptation for neighborhood-wide shared data model
- Strong offline-first capabilities
- Less mature ecosystem for forum-like features

### Option 2: CouchDB + PouchDB

**Architecture**:
- Multi-master replication: Every node is equal, bidirectional sync
- Conflict resolution: Built-in CRDT-like merging
- HTTP-based: Easy to understand, debug, deploy
- Proven: Used by companies for offline-first apps

**The fit**: Probably closest to what we want. Each node runs CouchDB, they replicate to each other, conflicts auto-resolve (last-write-wins or custom logic).

**Considerations**:
- Well-documented and mature
- HTTP API is accessible
- Good tooling and monitoring
- Straightforward deployment model

### Option 3: Gun.js

**Architecture**:
- Real-time distributed graph database
- No servers needed (though you can have server nodes)
- Cryptographic identity: Built-in security
- Resilient by design: Works peer-to-peer or with relay nodes

**The fit**: Very aligned with the vision, but less mature ecosystem than CouchDB.

**Considerations**:
- Novel approach, less production battle-testing
- Real-time sync could be compelling for UX
- Smaller community and ecosystem

## Proposed Architecture Sketch

### Single Node Setup:
```
[Node 1: Single host]
      ↕
[All members connect to this node]
```

### Multi-Node Setup (Optional):
```
[Node 1: Your house]  ←→  [Node 2: Dan's house]  ←→  [Node 3: Sarah's house]
      ↕                          ↕                          ↕
[Members access any node - data syncs between all nodes]
```

### How It Works:

1. **Start with one node** (Raspberry Pi, old laptop, VPS)
2. **Optionally add more nodes** as neighbors volunteer to operate them
3. **Each node runs the same software** (forum + database)
4. **Multiple nodes continuously sync** via bidirectional replication
5. **Members connect to any available node** (if one is down, others serve requests)
6. **Voting is cryptographically signed** when multi-node governance is active

## The Governance Layer

This is where it gets interesting. We need democratic controls baked into the technical architecture.

### Node Operator Agreement:
- Any member can propose running a node
- Community votes to approve new node operators
- No hard limits on node count (though practical considerations may limit it)
- Node operators commit to uptime expectations (details TBD)

### Democratic Controls:

Note: These governance mechanisms become relevant primarily in multi-node setups. Single-node communities would use simpler governance models.

**Content moderation** (multi-node): Any node operator can hide content, but requires consensus vote to permanently delete

**Banning users** (multi-node): Requires consensus vote of node operators

**Changing rules**: Constitutional amendments require community consensus

**Removing node operators** (multi-node): Requires consensus vote, their node is de-replicated

**Single node governance**: Traditional admin/moderator model with community input, possibility to add nodes later for democratic checks

### Technical Implementation:
- Use **signed messages** for all moderation actions (single or multi-node)
- Store votes in the replicated database (multi-node)
- Each node validates signatures and vote counts (multi-node)
- If node operator is voted out, their node stops receiving updates (multi-node)
- If they try to tamper, other nodes reject their changes (multi-node Byzantine fault tolerance)

## The "Nuclear Option" Protection

What if the majority of node operators collude or go rogue?

### Community Fork Mechanism:
- Any member can export the full database (it's replicated everywhere)
- They spin up new nodes with clean operators
- Previous operators are locked out
- Community migrates to new instance

This is like a **hard fork in blockchain governance**, but for neighborhood forums.

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: CouchDB-based Custom Build
- **Frontend**: Simple web app (React/Vue)
- **Backend**: Node.js API + CouchDB per node
- **Replication**: CouchDB's built-in multi-master sync
- **Cost per node**: $5-12/month VPS or self-hosted
- **Complexity**: Medium - CouchDB is well-documented

### Option 2: Adapt Existing Software
- Start with **Discourse** or **NodeBB** (both have plugin systems)
- Add **CouchDB replication layer** underneath
- Build **governance plugin** for voting
- **Cost**: Higher development ($15k-30k) but proven forum UX

### Option 3: Scuttlebutt Adaptation
- Fork **Manyverse** or **Patchwork**
- Adapt for neighborhood use case (not personal feeds)
- Add classifieds/marketplace modules
- **Cost**: Lower hosting (peer-to-peer) but higher learning curve

## Multiple Neighborhoods

Each neighborhood runs their own isolated instance with their own node(s). There is no cross-neighborhood federation protocol. Each community is independent and self-contained.

## Why This Approach Is Compelling

1. **Low barrier to entry**: Start with single node, add more for resilience
2. **Scalable resilience**: No single point of failure when multi-node (technical or social)
3. **Democratic potential**: Multi-node enables checks on admin power
4. **Post-collapse ready**: Works with intermittent internet, local mesh networks
5. **Anti-fragile**: Multi-node communities can survive bad actors through voting
6. **Transition infrastructure**: Can evolve from VPS nodes → self-hosted → mesh networks → eventually offline

## Open Questions

1. **Conflict resolution**: How do we handle conflicting edits to the same post?
2. **Voting implementation**: Should votes be synchronous (all nodes online) or asynchronous?
3. **Bootstrap problem**: How does the first neighborhood get started with only 1-2 nodes?
4. **Identity management**: How do members authenticate across multiple nodes?
5. **Data model**: Forum-style threads, or something more flexible?
6. **Mobile access**: Do we need native apps or is mobile web sufficient?

## Next Steps

The database replication technology exists and is proven. The innovation is in:

1. **Governance layer** (voting, moderation, node operator management)
2. **UX simplicity** (members shouldn't think about nodes, just "the neighborhood forum")
3. **Platform coop structure** (legal + financial model)

Areas to explore further:
- Detailed governance voting system design
- CouchDB replication architecture deep-dive
- Conflict resolution strategies for community data
- Identity and authentication across nodes
- Initial deployment and bootstrap process
