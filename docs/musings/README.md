# Musings

This directory contains exploratory thoughts, design explorations, and technical investigations for Groundwork Commons. Unlike Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), musings are free-form documents that explore ideas before they crystallize into formal decisions.

## Purpose

Musings serve as:

- **Thinking space** for exploring technical approaches without commitment
- **Design exploration** for trying out different architectural patterns
- **Question repository** for open questions that need investigation
- **Conversation starter** for discussing trade-offs and possibilities
- **Historical record** of how thinking evolved over time

## Format

Musings are dated and topic-labeled: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md`

This chronological organization shows how ideas evolved and provides context for decisions eventually captured in ADRs.

### 2025-10-21: Distributed Resilience
[2025-10-21-distributed-resilience.md](2025-10-21-distributed-resilience.md)

Exploration of multi-node replication strategies for neighborhood-scale resilience. Investigates the difference between federation (ATProto, ActivityPub) and distributed data replication (CouchDB, Scuttlebutt, Gun.js). Examines governance mechanisms for preventing admin tyranny through Byzantine fault tolerance and democratic voting.

**Key topics**:
- Multi-master replication vs federation
- CouchDB, Scuttlebutt, Gun.js comparison
- 3-5 node architecture rationale
- Democratic controls and voting mechanisms
- Community fork as "nuclear option"
- Implementation approaches

## From Musings to ADRs

When exploratory thinking in a musing leads to a concrete decision, that decision should be captured as an ADR:

1. A musing explores multiple approaches
2. Discussion and investigation narrow the options
3. A decision is made
4. An ADR is created documenting the decision with reference to the musing

Musings can remain open-ended. Not every musing needs to become an ADR.
