# Governance Framework

**Status**: Under Development

The governance framework for Groundwork Commons treats technical infrastructure as political infrastructure. This documentation will define how communities make decisions, elect node operators, moderate content, and maintain democratic control.

## Overview

Groundwork Commons is built on the principle that community infrastructure should be democratically controlled. The governance model prevents any single administrator from having unilateral control while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Governance Areas

This section will cover:

### Node Operators
- Election and approval process
- Responsibilities and commitments
- Removal procedures
- Term limits and rotation

### Moderation
- Content moderation policies
- Multi-node consensus requirements
- Appeal processes
- Escalation procedures

### Voting Mechanisms
- Voting eligibility
- Quorum requirements
- Decision thresholds (simple majority, 2/3, etc.)
- Constitutional amendments
- Technical implementation of secure voting

### Community Forks
- Process for community-initiated forks
- When and why forks might occur
- Technical procedures for splitting
- Governance during fork transitions

### Membership
- Membership criteria
- Onboarding processes
- Rights and responsibilities
- Suspension and removal

## Democratic Principles

The governance framework is guided by these principles:

1. **No single point of control**: Multi-node agreement required for significant actions
2. **Transparency**: All governance decisions visible to community
3. **Recallability**: Any position can be removed by community vote
4. **Forkability**: Communities can split if governance fails
5. **Local control**: No external authority can override community decisions

## Implementation Status

As Groundwork Commons is in concept development, governance procedures are being designed in parallel with technical architecture. Governance decisions will be documented in Architecture Decision Records as they are made.
