# Technical Documentation

**Status**: Under Development

This section will contain technical architecture documentation, API specifications, and implementation details for Groundwork Commons.

## Overview

Groundwork Commons is a distributed platform for hyperlocal communities that supports single-node or multi-node deployments with optional multi-master replication. The technical architecture balances operational simplicity with resilience and democratic governance requirements.

## Technical Topics

This section will cover:

### Architecture
- System architecture overview
- Component diagram and relationships
- Data flow between nodes
- Security architecture
- Scalability considerations

### Data Replication
- Single-node vs multi-node architecture
- Multi-master replication strategy (when multiple nodes exist)
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Synchronization protocols
- Data consistency guarantees
- Partition tolerance

### Database
- Database choice and rationale (see ADRs)
- Schema design
- Indexing strategy
- Query optimization
- Backup and recovery

### Authentication & Identity
- Member authentication across nodes
- Cryptographic identity management
- Session management
- Access control and permissions

### API Documentation
- REST/HTTP API endpoints
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Error handling

### Security
- Threat model
- Cryptographic signing of votes and moderation actions
- Transport security (TLS/SSL)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Byzantine fault tolerance considerations

### Performance
- Latency characteristics
- Throughput considerations
- Caching strategy
- Database optimization
- Monitoring and metrics

## Technology Stack

Technology choices will be documented in Architecture Decision Records. Current explorations include:

**Databases**:
- CouchDB (multi-master HTTP-based replication)
- Scuttlebutt (gossip protocol, offline-first)
- Gun.js (real-time distributed graph database)

**Backend**:
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
- Potential alternatives: Go, Rust, Elixir

**Frontend**:
- Web-based interface (React, Vue, or Svelte)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile
- Accessibility-first design

## Development Status

As Groundwork Commons is in concept development:

1. **Musings** explore technical approaches
2. **ADRs** document technology choices as they're made
3. **Technical documentation** will detail implementation
4. **Code** will be developed based on documented decisions
